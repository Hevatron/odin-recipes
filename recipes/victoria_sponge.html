            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>A Victoria Sponge is a well known classic - here's how to make Queen Vic's favourite dessert!</p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>100g self raising flour
                <li>100g butter, softened
                <li>100g caster sugar
                <li>2 eggs
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract
                <li>50g icing sugar (to dust)   
            </ul>
            <h3>Method</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Sift the flour into a medium bowl and set aside.
                <li>Beat butter and sugar with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. The mixture should be noticeably lighter in color. Add room-temperature eggs one at a time, allowing each egg to blend into butter mixture before adding the next. Beat in vanilla. Pour in the flour, mixing until just incorporated. Pour batter into prepared pan.
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Cool the cake in the pan for 10 minutes, then turn the cake out onto a wire rack to cool completely.
                <li>This cake can be served as is, just dusted with confectioners' sugar. Alternately, cut the cake in half horizontally and sandwich the layers together with jam or custard.
            </ol>
